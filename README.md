# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This project implements SVM for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.  
Both Linear and RBF kernels were tested, and hyperparameters (C and gamma) were tuned.

## Steps Completed
- Loaded Breast Cancer dataset
- Normalized features
- Trained SVM with Linear kernel
- Trained SVM with RBF kernel
- Performed hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma)
- Used Cross Validation
- Visualized confusion matrix and decision boundary

## Results
- The RBF kernel performed better than the linear model.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved accuracy.

## Tools Used
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab → Run all cells.
